# Early Rhino Grasshopper components

[Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com) is a plugin for [Rhinoceros](http://www.rhino3d.com). Rhino is a nurb-based 3d modeling tool commonly used for computational design and architecture.

The following components are old but still useful. They have not been tested onto post 2010 versions. There are great chances they still work.

- divisorplot: on3dpoints from divisors
- numberspiral: on3dpoints from both cartesian and polar number spiral
- primegenerator: generate prime numbers

Needed:\
2009-2010 versions of <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com">Rhinoceros</a> and <a href="http://www.grasshopper3d.com">Grasshopper</a>. The Grasshopper plugin was not part of Rhino by then.
