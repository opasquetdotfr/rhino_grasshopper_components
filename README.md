Early Rhino Grasshopper components.
<a href="http://www.grasshopper3d.com">Grasshopper</a> is a plugin for <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com">Rhinoceros</a>. Rhino is a nurb-based 3d modeling tool commonly used for computational design and architecture.
The following components are very simple, old but still useful. They have not been tested on post 2010 versions but there are great chances they still work.

divisorplot			on3dpoints from divisors
numberspiral		on3dpoints from both cartesian and polar number spiral
primegenerator		generate prime numbers

Needed:
2009-2010 version of <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com">Rhinoceros</a> and <a href="http://www.grasshopper3d.com">Grasshopper</a>. Grasshopper was not part of Rhino by then.
